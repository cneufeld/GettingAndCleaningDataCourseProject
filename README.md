#Getting and Cleaning Data Course ProjectThis repo contains the source code, code book, and an output file for the Getting and Cleaning Data course project on Coursera.##Source CodeTo execute the code, load the "run_analysis.R" file in R, and set your working directory to the UCI HAR Dataset.  It is expected that this data has already been downloaded and unzipped to your local machine.To execute the code:```source("./run_analysis.R");run_analysis();```Executing the code will:* reads train and test data sets and assign initial column names* merge data sets* remove columns that are not relevant* rename columns to more human-readable format* writes the merged data set to  rawdata.csv * generates the tidy data set* writes the tidy data set to  tidydata.csv * returns the tidy data set
