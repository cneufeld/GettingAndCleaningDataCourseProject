#Getting and Cleaning Data Course ProjectThis repo contains the source code, code book, and an output file for the Getting and Cleaning Data course project on Coursera.##Source CodeTo execute the code, load the "run_analysis.R" file in R, and set your working directory to the UCI HAR Dataset.  It is expected that this data has already been downloaded and unzipped to your local machine.To execute the code:```source("./run_analysis.R");run_analysis();```Executing the code will load the test and training data provided in the UCI HAR Dataset, remove the columns that were not of interest to this project, rename the columns to a more "human readable" format, and export the data to a "tidy" dataset.
